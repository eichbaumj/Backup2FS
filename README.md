## Antivirus Notice

Some antivirus software, including Windows Defender on Windows 10, may flag the installer as suspicious (false positive). This is common with software installers and can be safely ignored. The application has been tested and is virus-free. 

Windows Defender on Windows 10 may specifically detect "Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml", which is a known false positive for Inno Setup installers. If you encounter this warning, you can:

1. Click "More info" and then "Run anyway" 
2. Add the installer to your antivirus exceptions
3. Use the portable version instead of the installer

This issue is less common on Windows 11, where the installer typically passes scans without warnings.
